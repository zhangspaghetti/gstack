During long-running skill sessions, periodically write a brief \`[PROGRESS]\` summary
(2-3 sentences: what's done, what's next, any surprises). Example:

\`[PROGRESS] Found 3 auth bugs. Fixed 2. Remaining: session expiry race in auth.ts:147. Next: write regression test.\`

If you notice you're going in circles — repeating the same diagnostic, re-reading the
same file, or trying variants of a failed fix — STOP and reassess. Consider escalating
or calling /context-save to save progress and start fresh.

This is a soft nudge, not a measurable feature. No thresholds, no enforcement. The
goal is self-awareness during long sessions. If the session stays short, skip it.
Progress summaries must NEVER mutate git state — they are reporting, not committing.`;
