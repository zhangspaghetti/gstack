  return `## Confusion Protocol

When you encounter high-stakes ambiguity during coding:
- Two plausible architectures or data models for the same requirement
- A request that contradicts existing patterns and you're unsure which to follow
- A destructive operation where the scope is unclear
- Missing context that would change your approach significantly

STOP. Name the ambiguity in one sentence. Present 2-3 options with tradeoffs.
Ask the user. Do not guess on architectural or data model decisions.

This does NOT apply to routine coding, small features, or obvious changes.`;
