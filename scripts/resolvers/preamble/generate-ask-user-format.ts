### Tool resolution (read first)

"AskUserQuestion" can resolve to two tools at runtime: the **host MCP variant** (e.g. \`mcp__conductor__AskUserQuestion\` — appears in your tool list when the host registers it) or the **native** Claude Code tool.

**Rule:** if any \`mcp__*__AskUserQuestion\` variant is in your tool list, prefer it. Hosts may disable native AUQ via \`--disallowedTools AskUserQuestion\` (Conductor does, by default) and route through their MCP variant; calling native there silently fails. Same questions/options shape; same decision-brief format applies.

**Fallback when neither variant is callable:** in plan mode, write the decision brief into the plan file as a \`## Decisions to confirm\` section + ExitPlanMode (the native "Ready to execute?" surfaces it). Outside plan mode, output the brief as prose and stop. **Never silently auto-decide** — only \`/plan-tune\` AUTO_DECIDE opt-ins authorize auto-picking.

### Format

Every AskUserQuestion is a decision brief and must be sent as tool_use, not prose.

\`\`\`
D<N> — <one-line question title>
Project/branch/task: <1 short grounding sentence using _BRANCH>
ELI10: <plain English a 16-year-old could follow, 2-4 sentences, name the stakes>
Stakes if we pick wrong: <one sentence on what breaks, what user sees, what's lost>
Recommendation: <choice> because <one-line reason>
Completeness: A=X/10, B=Y/10   (or: Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score)
Pros / cons:
A) <option label> (recommended)
  ✅ <pro — concrete, observable, ≥40 chars>
  ❌ <con — honest, ≥40 chars>
B) <option label>
  ✅ <pro>
  ❌ <con>
Net: <one-line synthesis of what you're actually trading off>
\`\`\`

D-numbering: first question in a skill invocation is \`D1\`; increment yourself. This is a model-level instruction, not a runtime counter.

ELI10 is always present, in plain English, not function names. Recommendation is ALWAYS present. Keep the \`(recommended)\` label; AUTO_DECIDE depends on it.

Completeness: use \`Completeness: N/10\` only when options differ in coverage. 10 = complete, 7 = happy path, 3 = shortcut. If options differ in kind, write: \`Note: options differ in kind, not coverage — no completeness score.\`

Pros / cons: use ✅ and ❌. Minimum 2 pros and 1 con per option when the choice is real; Minimum 40 characters per bullet. Hard-stop escape for one-way/destructive confirmations: \`✅ No cons — this is a hard-stop choice\`.

Neutral posture: \`Recommendation: <default> — this is a taste call, no strong preference either way\`; \`(recommended)\` STAYS on the default option for AUTO_DECIDE.

Effort both-scales: when an option involves effort, label both human-team and CC+gstack time, e.g. \`(human: ~2 days / CC: ~15 min)\`. Makes AI compression visible at decision time.

Net line closes the tradeoff. Per-skill instructions may add stricter rules.

### Self-check before emitting

Before calling AskUserQuestion, verify:
- [ ] D<N> header present
- [ ] ELI10 paragraph present (stakes line too)
- [ ] Recommendation line present with concrete reason
- [ ] Completeness scored (coverage) OR kind-note present (kind)
- [ ] Every option has ≥2 ✅ and ≥1 ❌, each ≥40 chars (or hard-stop escape)
- [ ] (recommended) label on one option (even for neutral-posture)
- [ ] Dual-scale effort labels on effort-bearing options (human / CC)
- [ ] Net line closes the decision
- [ ] You are calling the tool, not writing prose
