# TODOS

## Context skills

### `/context-save --lane` + `/context-restore --lane` for parallel workstreams

**What:** Let users save and restore per-workstream (lane) context independently. On save: `/context-save --lane A "backend refactor"` writes a lane-tagged file. Or `/context-save lanes` reads the "Parallelization Strategy" section of the most recent plan file and auto-generates one saved context per lane. On restore: `/context-restore --lane A` loads just that lane's context. Useful when a plan has 3 independent workstreams and the user wants to pick one up in each of 3 Conductor windows.

**Why:** Plans produced by `/plan-eng-review` already emit a lane table (Lane A: touches `models/` and `controllers/` sequentially; Lane B: touches `api/` independently; etc.). Right now there's no way to transfer that structure into resumable saved state. Users manually re-describe the scope in each window. Lane-tagged save/restore would be the bridge between "here's the plan" and "three people (or three AIs) are now working in parallel on it."

**Pros:** Turns `/plan-eng-review`'s parallelization output into actionable resume state. Reduces context-loss across Conductor workspace handoffs for multi-workstream plans.

**Cons:** Net-new functionality (not a port from the old `/checkpoint` skill). The "spawn new Conductor windows" part needs research into whether Conductor has a spawn CLI. Also requires lane-tagging discipline in the save step (manual or extracted).

**Context:** Source of the lane data model is `plan-eng-review/SKILL.md.tmpl:240-249` (the "Parallelization Strategy" output with Lane A/B/C dependency tables and conflict flags). Deferred from the v0.18.5.0 rename PR so the rename could land as a tight, low-risk fix. Saved files currently live at `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/checkpoints/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<title>.md` with YAML frontmatter (branch, timestamp, etc.). The lane feature would add a `lane:` field to frontmatter and a `--lane` filter to both skills.

**Effort:** M (human: ~1-2 days / CC: ~45-60 min)
**Priority:** P3 (nice-to-have, not blocking anyone yet)
**Depends on:** `/context-save` + `/context-restore` rename stable in production (v1.0.1.0+). Research: does Conductor expose a spawn-workspace CLI?

## P0: PACING_UPDATES_V0 — Louise's fatigue root cause (V1.1)

**What:** Implement the pacing overhaul extracted from PLAN_TUNING_V1. Full design in `docs/designs/PACING_UPDATES_V0.md`. Requires: session-state model, `phase` field in question-log schema, registry extension for dynamic findings, pacing as skill-template control flow (not preamble prose), `bin/gstack-flip-decision` command, migration-prompt budget rule, first-run preamble audit, ranking threshold calibration from real V0 data, one-way-door uncapped rule, concrete verification values.

**Why:** Louise de Sadeleer's "yes yes yes" during `/autoplan` was pacing + agency, not (only) jargon density. V1 addresses jargon (ELI10 writing). V1.1 addresses the interruption-volume half. Without this, V1 only gets halfway to the HOLY SHIT outcome.

**Pros:** End-to-end answer to Louise's feedback. Ships real calibration data from V1 usage. Completes the V0 → V2 pacing arc started in PLAN_TUNING_V0.

**Cons:** Substantial scope (10 items in `docs/designs/PACING_UPDATES_V0.md`). Needs its own CEO + Codex + DX + Eng review cycle. Calibration depends on real V0 question-log distribution.

**Context:** PLAN_TUNING_V1 attempted to bundle pacing. Three eng-review passes + two Codex passes surfaced 10 structural gaps unfixable via plan-text editing. Extracted to V1.1 as a dedicated plan.

**Depends on / blocked by:** V1 shipping (provides Louise's baseline transcript for calibration).

## Plan Tune (v2 deferrals from v0.19.0.0 rollback)

All six items are gated on v1 dogfood results and the acceptance criteria in
`docs/designs/PLAN_TUNING_V0.md`. They were explicitly deferred after Codex's
outside-voice review drove a scope rollback from the CEO EXPANSION plan. v1
ships the observational substrate only; v2 adds behavior adaptation.

### E1 — Substrate wiring (5 skills consume profile)

**What:** Add `{{PROFILE_ADAPTATION:<skill>}}` placeholder to ship, review,
office-hours, plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review SKILL.md.tmpl files. Implement
`scripts/resolvers/profile-consumer.ts` with a per-skill adaptation registry
(`scripts/profile-adaptations/{skill}.ts`). Each consumer reads
`~/.gstack/developer-profile.json` on preamble and adapts skill-specific
defaults (verbosity, mode selection, severity thresholds, pushback intensity).

**Why:** v1 observational profile writes a file nobody reads. The substrate
claim only becomes real when skills actually consume it. Without this, /plan-tune
is a fancy config page.

**Pros:** gstack feels personal. Every skill adapts to the user's steering
style instead of defaulting to middle-of-the-road.

**Cons:** Risk of psychographic drift if profile is noisy. Requires calibrated
profile (v1 acceptance criteria: 90+ days stable across 3+ skills).

**Context:** See `docs/designs/PLAN_TUNING_V0.md` §Deferred to v2. v1 ships the
signal map + inferred computation; it's displayed in /plan-tune but no skill
reads it yet.

**Effort:** L (human: ~1 week / CC: ~4h)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** 2+ weeks of v1 dogfood, profile diversity check passing.

### E3 — `/plan-tune narrative` + `/plan-tune vibe`

**What:** Event-anchored narrative ("You accepted 7 scope expansions, overrode
test_failure_triage 4 times, called every PR 'boil the lake'") + one-word vibe
archetype (Cathedral Builder, Ship-It Pragmatist, Deep Craft, etc).
scripts/archetypes.ts is ALREADY SHIPPED in v1 (8 archetypes + Polymath
fallback). v2 work is the narrative generator + /plan-tune skill wiring.

**Why:** Makes profile tangible and shareable. Screenshot-able.

**Pros:** Killer delight feature. Social surface for gstack. Concrete, specific
output anchored in real events (not generic AI slop).

**Cons:** Requires stable inferred profile — without calibration it produces
generic paragraphs. Gen-tests need to validate no-slop.

**Context:** Archetypes already defined. Just need the /plan-tune narrative
subcommand + slop-check test.

**Effort:** S+ (human: ~1 day / CC: ~1h)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** Calibrated profile (>= 20 events, 3+ skills, 7+ days span).

### E4 — Blind-spot coach

**What:** Preamble injection that surfaces the OPPOSITE of the user's profile
once per session per tier >= 2 skill. Boil-the-ocean user gets challenged on
scope ("what's the 80% version?"); small-scope user gets challenged on ambition.
`scripts/resolvers/blind-spot-coach.ts`. Marker file for session dedup. Opt-out
via `gstack-config set blind_spot_coach false`.

**Why:** Makes gstack a coach (challenges you) instead of a mirror (reflects
you). The killer differentiation vs. a settings menu.

**Pros:** The feature that makes gstack feel like Garry. Surfaces assumptions
the user hasn't challenged.

**Cons:** Logically conflicts with E1 (which adapts TO profile) and E6 (which
flags mismatch). Requires interaction-budget design: global session budget +
escalation rules + explicit exclusion from mismatch detection. Risk of feeling
like a nag if fires wrong.

**Context:** v2 must redesign to resolve the E1/E4/E6 composition issue Codex
caught. Dogfood required to calibrate frequency.

**Effort:** M (human: ~3 days / CC: ~2h design + ~1h impl)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** E1 shipped + interaction-budget design spec.

### E5 — LANDED celebration HTML page

**What:** When a PR authored by the user is newly merged to the base branch,
open an animated HTML celebration page in the browser. Confetti + typewriter
headline + stats counter. Shows: what we built (PR stats + CHANGELOG entry),
road traveled (scope decisions from CEO plan), road not traveled (deferred
items), where we're going (next TODOs), who you are as a builder (vibe +
narrative + profile delta for this ship). Self-contained HTML (CSS animations
only, no JS deps).

**CRITICAL REVISION from v0 plan:** Passive detection must NOT live in the
preamble (Codex #9). When promoted, moves to explicit `/plan-tune show-landed`
OR post-ship hook — not passive detection in the hot path.

**Why:** Biggest personality moment in gstack. The "one-word thing that makes
you remember why you built this."

**Pros:** Screenshot-worthy. Shareable. The kind of dopamine hit that turns
power users into evangelists.

**Cons:** Product theater if the substrate isn't solid. Needs /design-shotgun
→ /design-html for the visual direction. Requires E2 unified profile for
narrative/vibe data.

**Context:** /land-and-deploy trust/adoption is low, so passive detection is
the right trigger shape. Dedup marker per PR in `~/.gstack/.landed-celebrated-*`.
E2E tests for squash/merge-commit/rebase/co-author/fresh-clone/dedup variants.

**Effort:** M+ (human: ~1 week / CC: ~3h total)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** E3 narrative/vibe shipped. /design-shotgun run on real PR data
to pick a visual direction, then /design-html to finalize.

### E6 — Auto-adjustment based on declared ↔ inferred mismatch

**What:** Currently `/plan-tune` shows the gap between declared and inferred
(v1 observational). v2 auto-suggests declaration updates when the gap exceeds
a threshold ("Your profile says hands-off but you've overridden 40% of
recommendations — you're actually taste-driven. Update declared autonomy from
0.8 to 0.5?"). Requires explicit user confirmation before any mutation (Codex
trust-boundary #15 already baked into v1).

**Why:** Profile drifts silently without correction. Self-correcting profile
stays honest.

**Pros:** Profile becomes more accurate over time. User sees the gap and
decides.

**Cons:** Requires stable inferred profile (diversity check). False positives
nag the user.

**Context:** v1 has `--check-mismatch` that flags > 0.3 gaps but doesn't
suggest fixes. v2 adds the suggestion UX + per-dimension threshold tuning from
real data.

**Effort:** S (human: ~1 day / CC: ~45min)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** Calibrated profile + real mismatch data from v1 dogfood.

### E7 — Psychographic auto-decide

**What:** When inferred profile is calibrated AND a question is two-way AND
the user's dimensions strongly favor one option, auto-choose without asking
(visible annotation: "Auto-decided via profile. Change with /plan-tune."). v1
only auto-decides via EXPLICIT per-question preferences; v2 adds profile-driven
auto-decide.

**Why:** The whole point of the psychographic. Silent, correct defaults based
on who the user IS, not just what they've said.

**Pros:** Friction-free skill invocation for calibrated power users. Over time,
gstack feels like it's reading your mind.

**Cons:** Highest-risk deferral. Wrong auto-decides are costly. Requires very
high confidence in the signal map AND calibration gate.

**Context:** v1 diversity gate is `sample_size >= 20 AND skills_covered >= 3
AND question_ids_covered >= 8 AND days_span >= 7`. v2 must prove this gate
actually catches noisy profiles before shipping.

**Effort:** M (human: ~3 days / CC: ~2h)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** E1 (skills consuming profile) + real observed data showing
calibration gate is trustworthy.

## Browse

### Scope sidebar-agent kill to session PID, not `pkill -f sidebar-agent\.ts`

**What:** `shutdown()` in `browse/src/server.ts:1193` uses `pkill -f sidebar-agent\.ts` to kill the sidebar-agent daemon, which matches every sidebar-agent on the machine, not just the one this server spawned. Replace with PID tracking: store the sidebar-agent PID when `cli.ts` spawns it (via state file or env), then `process.kill(pid, 'SIGTERM')` in `shutdown()`.

**Why:** A user running two Conductor worktrees (or any multi-session setup), each with its own `$B connect`, closes one browser window ... and the other worktree's sidebar-agent gets killed too. The blast radius was there before, but the v0.18.1.0 disconnect-cleanup fix makes it more reachable: every user-close now runs the full `shutdown()` path, whereas before user-close bypassed it.

**Context:** Surfaced by /ship's adversarial review on v0.18.1.0. Pre-existing code, not introduced by the fix. Fix requires propagating the sidebar-agent PID from `cli.ts` spawn site (~line 885) into the server's state file so `shutdown()` can target just this session's agent. Related: `browse/src/cli.ts` spawns with `Bun.spawn(...).unref()` and already captures `agentProc.pid`.

**Effort:** S (human: ~2h / CC: ~15min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Sidebar Security

### ML Prompt Injection Classifier

**What:** Add DeBERTa-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2 via @huggingface/transformers v4 (WASM backend) as an ML defense layer for the Chrome sidebar. Reusable `browse/src/security.ts` module with `checkInjection()` API. Includes canary tokens, attack logging, shield icon, special telemetry (AskUserQuestion on detection even when telemetry off), and BrowseSafe-bench red team test harness (3,680 adversarial cases from Perplexity).

**Why:** PR 1 fixes the architecture (command allowlist, XML framing, Opus default). But attackers can still trick Claude into navigating to phishing sites or exfiltrating visible page data via allowed browse commands. The ML classifier catches prompt injection patterns that architectural controls can't see. 94.8% accuracy, 99.6% recall, ~50-100ms inference via WASM. Defense-in-depth.

**Context:** Full design doc with industry research, open source tool landscape, Codex review findings, and ambitious Bun-native vision (5ms inference via FFI + Apple Accelerate): [`docs/designs/ML_PROMPT_INJECTION_KILLER.md`](docs/designs/ML_PROMPT_INJECTION_KILLER.md). CEO plan with scope decisions: `~/.gstack/projects/garrytan-gstack/ceo-plans/2026-03-28-sidebar-prompt-injection-defense.md`.

**Effort:** L (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~3-4 hours)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** Sidebar security fix PR (command allowlist + XML framing + arg fix) landing first

## Builder Ethos

### First-time Search Before Building intro

**What:** Add a `generateSearchIntro()` function (like `generateLakeIntro()`) that introduces the Search Before Building principle on first use, with a link to the blog essay.

**Why:** Boil the Lake has an intro flow that links to the essay and marks `.completeness-intro-seen`. Search Before Building should have the same pattern for discoverability.

**Context:** Blocked on a blog post to link to. When the essay exists, add the intro flow with a `.search-intro-seen` marker file. Pattern: `generateLakeIntro()` at gen-skill-docs.ts:176.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Blog post about Search Before Building

## Chrome DevTools MCP Integration

### Real Chrome session access

**What:** Integrate Chrome DevTools MCP to connect to the user's real Chrome session with real cookies, real state, no Playwright middleman.

**Why:** Right now, headed mode launches a fresh Chromium profile. Users must log in manually or import cookies. Chrome DevTools MCP connects to the user's actual Chrome ... instant access to every authenticated site. This is the future of browser automation for AI agents.

**Context:** Google shipped Chrome DevTools MCP in Chrome 146+ (June 2025). It provides screenshots, console messages, performance traces, Lighthouse audits, and full page interaction through the user's real browser. gstack should use it for real-session access while keeping Playwright for headless CI/testing workflows.

Potential new skills:
- `/debug-browser`: JS error tracing with source-mapped stack traces
- `/perf-debug`: performance traces, Core Web Vitals, network waterfall

May replace `/setup-browser-cookies` for most use cases since the user's real cookies are already there.

**Effort:** L (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~2 hours)
**Priority:** P0
**Depends on:** Chrome 146+, DevTools MCP server installed

## Browse

### Bundle server.ts into compiled binary

**What:** Eliminate `resolveServerScript()` fallback chain entirely — bundle server.ts into the compiled browse binary.

**Why:** The current fallback chain (check adjacent to cli.ts, check global install) is fragile and caused bugs in v0.3.2. A single compiled binary is simpler and more reliable.

**Context:** Bun's `--compile` flag can bundle multiple entry points. The server is currently resolved at runtime via file path lookup. Bundling it removes the resolution step entirely.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Sessions (isolated browser instances)

**What:** Isolated browser instances with separate cookies/storage/history, addressable by name.

**Why:** Enables parallel testing of different user roles, A/B test verification, and clean auth state management.

**Context:** Requires Playwright browser context isolation. Each session gets its own context with independent cookies/localStorage. Prerequisite for video recording (clean context lifecycle) and auth vault.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3

### Video recording

**What:** Record browser interactions as video (start/stop controls).

**Why:** Video evidence in QA reports and PR bodies. Currently deferred because `recreateContext()` destroys page state.

**Context:** Needs sessions for clean context lifecycle. Playwright supports video recording per context. Also needs WebM → GIF conversion for PR embedding.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions

### v20 encryption format support

**What:** AES-256-GCM support for future Chromium cookie DB versions (currently v10).

**Why:** Future Chromium versions may change encryption format. Proactive support prevents breakage.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### State persistence — SHIPPED

~~**What:** Save/load cookies + localStorage to JSON files for reproducible test sessions.~~

`$B state save/load` ships in v0.12.1.0. V1 saves cookies + URLs only (not localStorage, which breaks on load-before-navigate). Files at `.gstack/browse-states/{name}.json` with 0o600 permissions. Load replaces session (closes all pages first). Name sanitized to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`.

**Remaining:** V2 localStorage support (needs pre-navigation injection strategy).
**Completed:** v0.12.1.0 (2026-03-26)

### Auth vault

**What:** Encrypted credential storage, referenced by name. LLM never sees passwords.

**Why:** Security — currently auth credentials flow through the LLM context. Vault keeps secrets out of the AI's view.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Sessions, state persistence

### Iframe support — SHIPPED

~~**What:** `frame <sel>` and `frame main` commands for cross-frame interaction.~~

`$B frame` ships in v0.12.1.0. Supports CSS selector, @ref, `--name`, and `--url` pattern matching. Execution target abstraction (`getActiveFrameOrPage()`) across all read/write/snapshot commands. Frame context cleared on navigation, tab switch, resume. Detached frame auto-recovery. Page-only operations (goto, screenshot, viewport) throw clear error when in frame context.

**Completed:** v0.12.1.0 (2026-03-26)

### Semantic locators

**What:** `find role/label/text/placeholder/testid` with attached actions.

**Why:** More resilient element selection than CSS selectors or ref numbers.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Device emulation presets

**What:** `set device "iPhone 16 Pro"` for mobile/tablet testing.

**Why:** Responsive layout testing without manual viewport resizing.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Network mocking/routing

**What:** Intercept, block, and mock network requests.

**Why:** Test error states, loading states, and offline behavior.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P4

### Download handling

**What:** Click-to-download with path control.

**Why:** Test file download flows end-to-end.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Content safety

**What:** `--max-output` truncation, `--allowed-domains` filtering.

**Why:** Prevent context window overflow and restrict navigation to safe domains.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4

### Streaming (WebSocket live preview)

**What:** WebSocket-based live preview for pair browsing sessions.

**Why:** Enables real-time collaboration — human watches AI browse.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P4

### Headed mode with Chrome extension — SHIPPED

`$B connect` launches Playwright's bundled Chromium in headed mode with the gstack Chrome extension auto-loaded. `$B handoff` now produces the same result (extension + side panel). Sidebar chat gated behind `--chat` flag.

### `$B watch` — SHIPPED

Claude observes user browsing in passive read-only mode with periodic snapshots. `$B watch stop` exits with summary. Mutation commands blocked during watch.

### Sidebar scout / file drop relay — SHIPPED

Sidebar agent writes structured messages to `.context/sidebar-inbox/`. Workspace agent reads via `$B inbox`. Message format: `{type, timestamp, page, userMessage, sidebarSessionId}`.

### Multi-agent tab isolation

**What:** Two Claude sessions connect to the same browser, each operating on different tabs. No cross-contamination.

**Why:** Enables parallel /qa + /design-review on different tabs in the same browser.

**Context:** Requires tab ownership model for concurrent headed connections. Playwright may not cleanly support two persistent contexts. Needs investigation.

**Effort:** L (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~2 hours)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Headed mode (shipped)

### Sidebar agent needs Write tool + better error visibility — SHIPPED

**What:** Two issues with the sidebar agent (`sidebar-agent.ts`): (1) `--allowedTools` is hardcoded to `Bash,Read,Glob,Grep`, missing `Write`. Claude can't create files (like CSVs) when asked. (2) When Claude errors or returns empty, the sidebar UI shows nothing, just a green dot. No error message, no "I tried but failed", nothing.

**Completed:** v0.15.4.0 (2026-04-04). Write tool added to allowedTools. 40+ empty catch blocks replaced with `[gstack sidebar]`, `[gstack bg]`, `[browse]`, `[sidebar-agent]` prefixed console logging across all 4 files (sidepanel.js, background.js, server.ts, sidebar-agent.ts). Error placeholder text now shows in red. Auth token stale-refresh bug fixed.

### Sidebar direct API calls (eliminate claude -p startup tax)

**What:** Each sidebar message spawns a fresh `claude -p` process (~2-3s cold start overhead). For "click @e24" that's absurd. Direct Anthropic API calls would be sub-second.

**Why:** The `claude -p` startup cost is: process spawn (~100ms) + CLI init (~500ms-1s) + API connection (~200ms) + first token. Model routing (Sonnet for actions) helps but doesn't fix the CLI overhead.

**Context:** `server.ts:spawnClaude()` builds args and writes to queue file. `sidebar-agent.ts:askClaude()` spawns `claude -p`. Replace with direct `fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/...')` with tool use. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` accessible to the browse server.

**Effort:** M (human: ~1 week / CC: ~30min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Chrome Web Store publishing

**What:** Publish the gstack browse Chrome extension to Chrome Web Store for easier install.

**Why:** Currently sideloaded via chrome://extensions. Web Store makes install one-click.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P4
**Depends on:** Chrome extension proving value via sideloading

### Linux cookie decryption — PARTIALLY SHIPPED

~~**What:** GNOME Keyring / kwallet / DPAPI support for non-macOS cookie import.~~

Linux cookie import shipped in v0.11.11.0 (Wave 3). Supports Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge on Linux with GNOME Keyring (libsecret) and "peanuts" fallback. Windows DPAPI support remains deferred.

**Remaining:** Windows cookie decryption (DPAPI). Needs complete rewrite — PR #64 was 1346 lines and stale.

**Effort:** L (Windows only)
**Priority:** P4
**Completed (Linux):** v0.11.11.0 (2026-03-23)

## Ship

### /ship Step 12 test harness should exec the actual template bash, not a reimplementation

**What:** `test/ship-version-sync.test.ts` currently reimplements the bash from `ship/SKILL.md.tmpl` Step 12 inside template literals. When the template changes, both sides must be updated — exactly the drift-risk pattern the Step 12 fix is meant to prevent, applied to our own testing strategy. Replace with a helper that extracts the fenced bash blocks from the template at test time and runs them verbatim (similar to the `skill-parser.ts` pattern).

**Why:** Surfaced by the Claude adversarial subagent during the v1.0.1.0 ship. Today the tests would stay green while the template regresses, because the error-message strings already differ between test and template. It's a silent-drift bug waiting to happen.

**Context:** The fixed test file is at `test/ship-version-sync.test.ts` (branched off garrytan/ship-version-sync). Existing precedent for extracting-from-skill-md is at `test/helpers/skill-parser.ts`. Pattern: read the template, slice from `## Step 12` to the next `---`, grep fenced bash, feed to `/bin/bash` with substituted fixtures.

**Effort:** S (human: ~2h / CC: ~30min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None.

### /ship Step 12 BASE_VERSION silent fallback to 0.0.0.0 when git show fails

**What:** `BASE_VERSION=$(git show origin/<base>:VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0.0")` silently defaults to `0.0.0.0` in any failure mode — detached HEAD, no origin, offline, base branch renamed. In such states, a real drift could be misclassified or silently repaired with the wrong value. Distinguish "origin/<base> unreachable" from "origin/<base>:VERSION absent" and fail loudly on the former.

**Why:** Flagged as CRITICAL (confidence 8/10) by the Claude adversarial subagent during the v1.0.1.0 ship. Low practical risk because `/ship` Step 3 already fetches origin before Step 12 runs — any reachability failure would abort Step 3 long before this code runs. Still, defense in depth: if someone invokes Step 12 bash outside the full /ship pipeline (e.g., via a standalone helper), the fallback masks a real problem.

**Context:** Fix: wrap with `git rev-parse --verify origin/<base>` probe; if that fails, error out rather than defaulting. Touches `ship/SKILL.md.tmpl` Step 12 idempotency block (around line 409). Tests need a case where `git show` fails.

**Effort:** S (human: ~1h / CC: ~15min)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** None.

### GitLab support for /land-and-deploy

**What:** Add GitLab MR merge + CI polling support to `/land-and-deploy` skill. Currently uses `gh pr view`, `gh pr checks`, `gh pr merge`, and `gh run list/view` in 15+ places — each needs a GitLab conditional path using `glab ci status`, `glab mr merge`, etc.

**Why:** Without this, GitLab users can `/ship` (create MR) but can't `/land-and-deploy` (merge + verify). Completes the GitLab story end-to-end.

**Context:** `/retro`, `/ship`, and `/document-release` now support GitLab via the multi-platform `BASE_BRANCH_DETECT` resolver. `/land-and-deploy` has deeper GitHub-specific semantics (merge queues, required checks via `gh pr checks`, deploy workflow polling) that have different shapes on GitLab. The `glab` CLI (v1.90.0) supports `glab mr merge`, `glab ci status`, `glab ci view` but with different output formats and no merge queue concept.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None (BASE_BRANCH_DETECT multi-platform resolver is already done)

### Multi-commit CHANGELOG completeness eval

**What:** Add a periodic E2E eval that creates a branch with 5+ commits spanning 3+ themes (features, cleanup, infra), runs /ship's Step 5 CHANGELOG generation, and verifies the CHANGELOG mentions all themes.

**Why:** The bug fixed in v0.11.22 (garrytan/ship-full-commit-coverage) showed that /ship's CHANGELOG generation biased toward recent commits on long branches. The prompt fix adds a cross-check, but no test exercises the multi-commit failure mode. The existing `ship-local-workflow` E2E only uses a single-commit branch.

**Context:** Would be a `periodic` tier test (~$4/run, non-deterministic since it tests LLM instruction-following). Setup: create bare remote, clone, add 5+ commits across different themes on a feature branch, run Step 5 via `claude -p`, verify CHANGELOG output covers all themes. Pattern: `ship-local-workflow` in `test/skill-e2e-workflow.test.ts`.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** None

### Ship log — persistent record of /ship runs

**What:** Append structured JSON entry to `.gstack/ship-log.json` at end of every /ship run (version, date, branch, PR URL, review findings, Greptile stats, todos completed, test results).

**Why:** /retro has no structured data about shipping velocity. Ship log enables: PRs-per-week trending, review finding rates, Greptile signal over time, test suite growth.

**Context:** /retro already reads greptile-history.md — same pattern. Eval persistence (eval-store.ts) shows the JSON append pattern exists in the codebase. ~15 lines in ship template.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None


### Visual verification with screenshots in PR body

**What:** /ship Step 7.5: screenshot key pages after push, embed in PR body.

**Why:** Visual evidence in PRs. Reviewers see what changed without deploying locally.

**Context:** Part of Phase 3.6. Needs S3 upload for image hosting.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

## Review

### Inline PR annotations

**What:** /ship and /review post inline review comments at specific file:line locations using `gh api` to create pull request review comments.

**Why:** Line-level annotations are more actionable than top-level comments. The PR thread becomes a line-by-line conversation between Greptile, Claude, and human reviewers.

**Context:** GitHub supports inline review comments via `gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR/reviews`. Pairs naturally with Phase 3.6 visual annotations.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Greptile training feedback export

**What:** Aggregate greptile-history.md into machine-readable JSON summary of false positive patterns, exportable to the Greptile team for model improvement.

**Why:** Closes the feedback loop — Greptile can use FP data to stop making the same mistakes on your codebase.

**Context:** Was a P3 Future Idea. Upgraded to P2 now that greptile-history.md data infrastructure exists. The signal data is already being collected; this just makes it exportable. ~40 lines.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Enough FP data accumulated (10+ entries)

### Visual review with annotated screenshots

**What:** /review Step 4.5: browse PR's preview deploy, annotated screenshots of changed pages, compare against production, check responsive layouts, verify accessibility tree.

**Why:** Visual diff catches layout regressions that code review misses.

**Context:** Part of Phase 3.6. Needs S3 upload for image hosting.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

## QA

### QA trend tracking

**What:** Compare baseline.json over time, detect regressions across QA runs.

**Why:** Spot quality trends — is the app getting better or worse?

**Context:** QA already writes structured reports. This adds cross-run comparison.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2

### CI/CD QA integration

**What:** `/qa` as GitHub Action step, fail PR if health score drops.

**Why:** Automated quality gate in CI. Catch regressions before merge.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### Smart default QA tier

**What:** After a few runs, check index.md for user's usual tier pick, skip the AskUserQuestion.

**Why:** Reduces friction for repeat users.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2

### Accessibility audit mode

**What:** `--a11y` flag for focused accessibility testing.

**Why:** Dedicated accessibility testing beyond the general QA checklist.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3

### CI/CD generation for non-GitHub providers

**What:** Extend CI/CD bootstrap to generate GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`), CircleCI (`.circleci/config.yml`), and Bitrise pipelines.

**Why:** Not all projects use GitHub Actions. Universal CI/CD bootstrap would make test bootstrap work for everyone.

**Context:** v1 ships with GitHub Actions only. Detection logic already checks for `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/`, `bitrise.yml` and skips with an informational note. Each provider needs ~20 lines of template text in `generateTestBootstrap()`.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Test bootstrap (shipped)

### Auto-upgrade weak tests (★) to strong tests (★★★)

**What:** When Step 7 coverage audit identifies existing ★-rated tests (smoke/trivial assertions), generate improved versions testing edge cases and error paths.

**Why:** Many codebases have tests that technically exist but don't catch real bugs — `expect(component).toBeDefined()` isn't testing behavior. Upgrading these closes the gap between "has tests" and "has good tests."

**Context:** Requires the quality scoring rubric from the test coverage audit. Modifying existing test files is riskier than creating new ones — needs careful diffing to ensure the upgraded test still passes. Consider creating a companion test file rather than modifying the original.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Test quality scoring (shipped)

## Retro

### Deployment health tracking (retro + browse)

**What:** Screenshot production state, check perf metrics (page load times), count console errors across key pages, track trends over retro window.

**Why:** Retro should include production health alongside code metrics.

**Context:** Requires browse integration. Screenshots + metrics fed into retro output.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Browse sessions

## Infrastructure

### /setup-gstack-upload skill (S3 bucket)

**What:** Configure S3 bucket for image hosting. One-time setup for visual PR annotations.

**Why:** Prerequisite for visual PR annotations in /ship and /review.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2

### gstack-upload helper

**What:** `browse/bin/gstack-upload` — upload file to S3, return public URL.

**Why:** Shared utility for all skills that need to embed images in PRs.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /setup-gstack-upload

### WebM to GIF conversion

**What:** ffmpeg-based WebM → GIF conversion for video evidence in PRs.

**Why:** GitHub PR bodies render GIFs but not WebM. Needed for video recording evidence.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Video recording



### Extend worktree isolation to Claude E2E tests

**What:** Add `useWorktree?: boolean` option to `runSkillTest()` so any Claude E2E test can opt into worktree mode for full repo context instead of tmpdir fixtures.

**Why:** Some Claude E2E tests (CSO audit, review-sql-injection) create minimal fake repos but would produce more realistic results with full repo context. The infrastructure exists (`describeWithWorktree()` in e2e-helpers.ts) — this extends it to the session-runner level.

**Context:** WorktreeManager shipped in v0.11.12.0. Currently only Gemini/Codex tests use worktrees. Claude tests use planted-bug fixture repos which are correct for their purpose, but new tests that want real repo context can use `describeWithWorktree()` today. This TODO is about making it even easier via a flag on `runSkillTest()`.

**Effort:** M (human: ~2 days / CC: ~20 min)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Worktree isolation (shipped v0.11.12.0)

### E2E model pinning — SHIPPED

~~**What:** Pin E2E tests to claude-sonnet-4-6 for cost efficiency, add retry:2 for flaky LLM responses.~~

Shipped: Default model changed to Sonnet for structure tests (~30), Opus retained for quality tests (~10). `--retry 2` added. `EVALS_MODEL` env var for override. `test:e2e:fast` tier added. Rate-limit telemetry (first_response_ms, max_inter_turn_ms) and wall_clock_ms tracking added to eval-store.

### Eval web dashboard

**What:** `bun run eval:dashboard` serves local HTML with charts: cost trending, detection rate, pass/fail history.

**Why:** Visual charts better for spotting trends than CLI tools.

**Context:** Reads `~/.gstack-dev/evals/*.json`. ~200 lines HTML + chart.js via Bun HTTP server.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Eval persistence (shipped in v0.3.6)

### CI/CD QA quality gate

**What:** Run `/qa` as a GitHub Action step, fail PR if health score drops below threshold.

**Why:** Automated quality gate catches regressions before merge. Currently QA is manual — CI integration makes it part of the standard workflow.

**Context:** Requires headless browse binary available in CI. The `/qa` skill already produces `baseline.json` with health scores — CI step would compare against the main branch baseline and fail if score drops. Would need `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in CI secrets since `/qa` uses Claude.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

### Cross-platform URL open helper

**What:** `gstack-open-url` helper script — detect platform, use `open` (macOS) or `xdg-open` (Linux).

**Why:** The first-time Completeness Principle intro uses macOS `open` to launch the essay. If gstack ever supports Linux, this silently fails.

**Effort:** S (human: ~30 min / CC: ~2 min)
**Priority:** P4
**Depends on:** Nothing

### CDP-based DOM mutation detection for ref staleness

**What:** Use Chrome DevTools Protocol `DOM.documentUpdated` / MutationObserver events to proactively invalidate stale refs when the DOM changes, without requiring an explicit `snapshot` call.

**Why:** Current ref staleness detection (async count() check) only catches stale refs at action time. CDP mutation detection would proactively warn when refs become stale, preventing the 5-second timeout entirely for SPA re-renders.

**Context:** Parts 1+2 of ref staleness fix (RefEntry metadata + eager validation via count()) are shipped. This is Part 3 — the most ambitious piece. Requires CDP session alongside Playwright, MutationObserver bridge, and careful performance tuning to avoid overhead on every DOM change.

**Effort:** L
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Ref staleness Parts 1+2 (shipped)

## Office Hours / Design

### Design docs → Supabase team store sync

**What:** Add design docs (`*-design-*.md`) to the Supabase sync pipeline alongside test plans, retro snapshots, and QA reports.

**Why:** Cross-team design discovery at scale. Local `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/` keyword-grep discovery works for same-machine users now, but Supabase sync makes it work across the whole team. Duplicate ideas surface, everyone sees what's been explored.

**Context:** /office-hours writes design docs to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/`. The team store already syncs test plans, retro snapshots, QA reports. Design docs follow the same pattern — just add a sync adapter.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** `garrytan/team-supabase-store` branch landing on main

### /yc-prep skill

**What:** Skill that helps founders prepare their YC application after /office-hours identifies strong signal. Pulls from the design doc, structures answers to YC app questions, runs a mock interview.

**Why:** Closes the loop. /office-hours identifies the founder, /yc-prep helps them apply well. The design doc already contains most of the raw material for a YC application.

**Effort:** M (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~2 hours)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** office-hours founder discovery engine shipping first

## Design Review

### /plan-design-review + /qa-design-review + /design-consultation — SHIPPED

Shipped as v0.5.0 on main. Includes `/plan-design-review` (report-only design audit), `/qa-design-review` (audit + fix loop), and `/design-consultation` (interactive DESIGN.md creation). `{{DESIGN_METHODOLOGY}}` resolver provides shared 80-item design audit checklist.

### Design outside voices in /plan-eng-review

**What:** Extend the parallel dual-voice pattern (Codex + Claude subagent) to /plan-eng-review's architecture review section.

**Why:** The design beachhead (v0.11.3.0) proves cross-model consensus works for subjective reviews. Architecture reviews have similar subjectivity in tradeoff decisions.

**Context:** Depends on learnings from the design beachhead. If the litmus scorecard format proves useful, adapt it for architecture dimensions (coupling, scaling, reversibility).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Design outside voices shipped (v0.11.3.0)

### Outside voices in /qa visual regression detection

**What:** Add Codex design voice to /qa for detecting visual regressions during bug-fix verification.

**Why:** When fixing bugs, the fix can introduce visual regressions that code-level checks miss. Codex could flag "the fix broke the responsive layout" during re-test.

**Context:** Depends on /qa having design awareness. Currently /qa focuses on functional testing.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Design outside voices shipped (v0.11.3.0)

## Document-Release

### Auto-invoke /document-release from /ship — SHIPPED

Shipped in v0.8.3. Step 8.5 added to `/ship` — after creating the PR, `/ship` automatically reads `document-release/SKILL.md` and executes the doc update workflow. Zero-friction doc updates.

### `{{DOC_VOICE}}` shared resolver

**What:** Create a placeholder resolver in gen-skill-docs.ts encoding the gstack voice guide (friendly, user-forward, lead with benefits). Inject into /ship Step 5, /document-release Step 5, and reference from CLAUDE.md.

**Why:** DRY — voice rules currently live inline in 3 places (CLAUDE.md CHANGELOG style section, /ship Step 5, /document-release Step 5). When the voice evolves, all three drift.

**Context:** Same pattern as `{{QA_METHODOLOGY}}` — shared block injected into multiple templates to prevent drift. ~20 lines in gen-skill-docs.ts.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None

## Ship Confidence Dashboard

### Smart review relevance detection — PARTIALLY SHIPPED

~~**What:** Auto-detect which of the 4 reviews are relevant based on branch changes (skip Design Review if no CSS/view changes, skip Code Review if plan-only).~~

`bin/gstack-diff-scope` shipped — categorizes diff into SCOPE_FRONTEND, SCOPE_BACKEND, SCOPE_PROMPTS, SCOPE_TESTS, SCOPE_DOCS, SCOPE_CONFIG. Used by design-review-lite to skip when no frontend files changed. Dashboard integration for conditional row display is a follow-up.

**Remaining:** Dashboard conditional row display (hide "Design Review: NOT YET RUN" when SCOPE_FRONTEND=false). Extend to Eng Review (skip for docs-only) and CEO Review (skip for config-only).

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** gstack-diff-scope (shipped)


## Codex

### Codex→Claude reverse buddy check skill

**What:** A Codex-native skill (`.agents/skills/gstack-claude/SKILL.md`) that runs `claude -p` to get an independent second opinion from Claude — the reverse of what `/codex` does today from Claude Code.

**Why:** Codex users deserve the same cross-model challenge that Claude users get via `/codex`. Currently the flow is one-way (Claude→Codex). Codex users have no way to get a Claude second opinion.

**Context:** The `/codex` skill template (`codex/SKILL.md.tmpl`) shows the pattern — it wraps `codex exec` with JSONL parsing, timeout handling, and structured output. The reverse skill would wrap `claude -p` with similar infrastructure. Would be generated into `.agents/skills/gstack-claude/` by `gen-skill-docs --host codex`.

**Effort:** M (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~30 min)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

## Completeness

### Completeness metrics dashboard

**What:** Track how often Claude chooses the complete option vs shortcut across gstack sessions. Aggregate into a dashboard showing completeness trend over time.

**Why:** Without measurement, we can't know if the Completeness Principle is working. Could surface patterns (e.g., certain skills still bias toward shortcuts).

**Context:** Would require logging choices (e.g., append to a JSONL file when AskUserQuestion resolves), parsing them, and displaying trends. Similar pattern to eval persistence.

**Effort:** M (human) / S (CC)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Boil the Lake shipped (v0.6.1)

## Safety & Observability

### On-demand hook skills (/careful, /freeze, /guard) — SHIPPED

~~**What:** Three new skills that use Claude Code's session-scoped PreToolUse hooks to add safety guardrails on demand.~~

Shipped as `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, and `/unfreeze` in v0.6.5. Includes hook fire-rate telemetry (pattern name only, no command content) and inline skill activation telemetry.

### Skill usage telemetry — SHIPPED

~~**What:** Track which skills get invoked, how often, from which repo.~~

Shipped in v0.6.5. TemplateContext in gen-skill-docs.ts bakes skill name into preamble telemetry line. Analytics CLI (`bun run analytics`) for querying. /retro integration shows skills-used-this-week.

### /investigate scoped debugging enhancements (gated on telemetry)

**What:** Six enhancements to /investigate auto-freeze, contingent on telemetry showing the freeze hook actually fires in real debugging sessions.

**Why:** /investigate v0.7.1 auto-freezes edits to the module being debugged. If telemetry shows the hook fires often, these enhancements make the experience smarter. If it never fires, the problem wasn't real and these aren't worth building.

**Context:** All items are prose additions to `investigate/SKILL.md.tmpl`. No new scripts.

**Items:**
1. Stack trace auto-detection for freeze directory (parse deepest app frame)
2. Freeze boundary widening (ask to widen instead of hard-block when hitting boundary)
3. Post-fix auto-unfreeze + full test suite run
4. Debug instrumentation cleanup (tag with DEBUG-TEMP, remove before commit)
5. Debug session persistence (~/.gstack/investigate-sessions/ — save investigation for reuse)
6. Investigation timeline in debug report (hypothesis log with timing)

**Effort:** M (all 6 combined)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Telemetry data showing freeze hook fires in real /investigate sessions

## Context Intelligence

### Context recovery preamble

**What:** Add ~10 lines of prose to the preamble telling the agent to re-read gstack artifacts (CEO plans, design reviews, eng reviews, checkpoints) after compaction or context degradation.

**Why:** gstack skills produce valuable artifacts stored at `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/`. When Claude's auto-compaction fires, it preserves a generic summary but doesn't know these artifacts exist. The plans and reviews that shaped the current work silently vanish from context, even though they're still on disk. This is the thing nobody else in the Claude Code ecosystem is solving, because nobody else has gstack's artifact architecture.

**Context:** Inspired by Anthropic's `claude-progress.txt` pattern for long-running agents. Also informed by claude-mem's "progressive disclosure" approach. See `docs/designs/SESSION_INTELLIGENCE.md` for the broader vision. CEO plan: `~/.gstack/projects/garrytan-gstack/ceo-plans/2026-03-31-session-intelligence-layer.md`.

**Effort:** S (human: ~30 min / CC: ~5 min)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None
**Key files:** `scripts/resolvers/preamble.ts`

### Session timeline

**What:** Append one-line JSONL entry to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/timeline.jsonl` after every skill run (timestamp, skill, branch, outcome). `/retro` renders the timeline.

**Why:** Makes AI-assisted work history visible. `/retro` can show "this week: 3 /review, 2 /ship, 1 /investigate." Provides the observability layer for the session intelligence architecture.

**Effort:** S (human: ~1h / CC: ~5 min)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None
**Key files:** `scripts/resolvers/preamble.ts`, `retro/SKILL.md.tmpl`

### Cross-session context injection

**What:** When a new gstack session starts on a branch with recent checkpoints or plans, the preamble prints a one-line summary: "Last session: implemented JWT auth, 3/5 tasks done." Agent knows where you left off before reading any files.

**Why:** Claude starts every session fresh. This one-liner orients the agent immediately. Similar to claude-mem's SessionStart hook pattern but simpler and integrated.

**Effort:** S (human: ~2h / CC: ~10 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Context recovery preamble

### /checkpoint skill

**What:** Manual skill to snapshot current working state: what's being done and why, files being edited, decisions made (and rationale), what's done vs. remaining, critical types/signatures. Saved to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/checkpoints/<timestamp>.md`.

**Why:** Useful before stepping away from a long session, before known-complex operations that might trigger compaction, for handing off context to a different agent/workspace, or coming back to a project after days away.

**Effort:** M (human: ~1 week / CC: ~30 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Context recovery preamble
**Key files:** New `checkpoint/SKILL.md.tmpl`, `scripts/gen-skill-docs.ts`

### Session Intelligence Layer design doc

**What:** Write `docs/designs/SESSION_INTELLIGENCE.md` describing the architectural vision: gstack as the persistent brain that survives Claude's ephemeral context. Every skill writes to `~/.gstack/projects/$SLUG/`, preamble re-reads, `/retro` rolls up.

**Why:** Connects context recovery, health, checkpoint, and timeline features into a coherent architecture. Nobody else in the ecosystem is building this.

**Effort:** S (human: ~2h / CC: ~15 min)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

## Health

### /health — Project Health Dashboard

**What:** Skill that runs type-check, lint, test suite, and dead code scan, then reports a composite 0-10 health score with breakdown by category. Tracks over time in `~/.gstack/health/<project-slug>/` for trend detection. Optionally integrates CodeScene MCP for deeper complexity/cohesion/coupling analysis.

**Why:** No quick way to get "state of the codebase" before starting work. CodeScene peer-reviewed research shows AI-generated code increases static analysis warnings by 30%, code complexity by 41%, and change failure rates by 30%. Users need guardrails. Like `/qa` but for code quality rather than browser behavior.

**Context:** Reads CLAUDE.md for project-specific commands (platform-agnostic principle). Runs checks in parallel. `/retro` can pull from health history for trend sparklines.

**Effort:** M (human: ~1 week / CC: ~30 min)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None
**Key files:** New `health/SKILL.md.tmpl`, `scripts/gen-skill-docs.ts`

### /health as /ship gate

**What:** If health score exists and drops below a configurable threshold, `/ship` warns before creating the PR: "Health dropped from 8/10 to 5/10 this branch — 3 new lint warnings, 1 test failure. Ship anyway?"

**Why:** Quality gate that prevents shipping degraded code. Configurable threshold so it's not blocking for teams that don't use `/health`.

**Effort:** S (human: ~1h / CC: ~5 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** /health skill

## Swarm

### Swarm primitive — reusable multi-agent dispatch

**What:** Extract Review Army's dispatch pattern into a reusable resolver (`scripts/resolvers/swarm.ts`). Wire into `/ship` for parallel pre-ship checks (type-check + lint + test in parallel sub-agents). Make available to `/qa`, `/investigate`, `/health`.

**Why:** Review Army proved parallel sub-agents work brilliantly (5 agents = 835K tokens of working memory vs. 167K for one). The pattern is locked inside `review-army.ts`. Other skills need it too. Claude Code Agent Teams (official, Feb 2026) validates the team-lead-delegates-to-specialists pattern. Gartner: multi-agent inquiries surged 1,445% in one year.

**Context:** Start with the specific `/ship` use case. Extract shared parts only after 2+ consumers reveal what config parameters are actually needed. Avoid premature abstraction. Can leverage existing WorktreeManager for isolation.

**Effort:** L (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~2 hours)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None
**Key files:** `scripts/resolvers/review-army.ts`, new `scripts/resolvers/swarm.ts`, `ship/SKILL.md.tmpl`, `lib/worktree.ts`

## Refactoring

### /refactor-prep — Pre-Refactor Token Hygiene

**What:** Skill that detects project language/framework, runs appropriate dead code detection (knip/ts-prune for TS/JS, vulture/autoflake for Python, staticcheck/deadcode for Go, cargo udeps for Rust), strips dead imports/exports/props/console.logs, and commits cleanup separately.

**Why:** Dirty codebases accelerate context compaction. Dead imports, unused exports, and orphaned code eat tokens that contribute nothing but everything to triggering compaction mid-refactor. Cleaning first buys back 20%+ of context budget. Reports lines removed and estimated token savings.

**Effort:** M (human: ~1 week / CC: ~30 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** None
**Key files:** New `refactor-prep/SKILL.md.tmpl`, `scripts/gen-skill-docs.ts`

## Factory Droid

### Browse MCP server for Factory Droid

**What:** Expose gstack's browse binary and key workflows as an MCP server that Factory Droid connects to natively. Factory users would run /mcp, add the gstack server, and get browse, QA, and review capabilities as Factory tools.

**Why:** Factory already supports 40+ MCP servers in its registry. Getting gstack's browse binary listed there is a distribution play. Nobody else has a real compiled browser binary as an MCP tool. This is the thing that makes gstack uniquely valuable on Factory Droid.

**Context:** Option A (--host factory compatibility shim) ships first in v0.13.4.0. Option B is the follow-up that provides deeper integration. The browse binary is already a stateless CLI, so wrapping it as an MCP server is straightforward (stdin/stdout JSON-RPC). Each browse command becomes an MCP tool.

**Effort:** L (human: ~1 week / CC: ~5 hours)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** --host factory (Option A, shipping in v0.13.4.0)

### .agent/skills/ dual output for cross-agent compatibility

**What:** Factory also reads from `<repo>/.agent/skills/` as a cross-agent compatibility path. Could output there in addition to `.factory/skills/` for broader reach across other agents that use the `.agent` convention.

**Why:** Multiple AI agents beyond Factory may adopt the `.agent/skills/` convention. Outputting there too would give free compatibility.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** --host factory

### Custom Droid definitions alongside skills

**What:** Factory has "custom droids" (subagents with tool restrictions, model selection, autonomy levels). Could ship `gstack-qa.md` droid configs alongside skills that restrict tools to read-only + execute for safety.

**Why:** Deeper Factory integration. Droid configs give Factory users tighter control over what gstack skills can do.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** --host factory

## GStack Browser

### Anti-bot stealth: Playwright CDP patches (rebrowser-style)

**What:** Write a postinstall script that patches Playwright's CDP layer to suppress `Runtime.enable` and use `addBinding` for context ID discovery, same approach as rebrowser-patches. Eliminates the `navigator.webdriver`, `cdc_` markers, and other CDP artifacts that sites like Google use to detect automation.

**Why:** Our current stealth patches (UA override, navigator.webdriver=false, fake plugins) work on most sites but Google still triggers captchas. The real detection is at the CDP protocol level. rebrowser-patches proved the approach works but their patches target Playwright 1.52.0 and don't apply to our 1.58.2. We need our own patcher using string matching instead of line-number diffs. 6 files, ~200 lines of patches total.

**Context:** Full analysis of rebrowser-patches source: patches 6 files in `playwright-core/lib/server/` (crConnection.js, crDevTools.js, crPage.js, crServiceWorker.js, frames.js, page.js). Key technique: suppress `Runtime.enable` (the main CDP detection vector), use `Runtime.addBinding` + `CustomEvent` trick to discover execution context IDs without it. Our extension communicates via Chrome extension APIs, not CDP Runtime, so it should be unaffected. Write E2E tests that verify: (1) extension still loads and connects, (2) Google.com loads without captcha, (3) sidebar chat still works.

**Effort:** L (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~3 hours)
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None

### Chromium fork (long-term alternative to CDP patches)

**What:** Maintain a Chromium fork where anti-bot stealth, GStack Browser branding, and native sidebar support live in the source code, not as runtime monkey-patches.

**Why:** The CDP patches are brittle. They break on every Playwright upgrade and target compiled JS with fragile string matching. A proper fork means: (1) stealth is permanent, not patched, (2) branding is native (no plist hacking at launch), (3) native sidebar replaces the extension (Phase 4 of V0 roadmap), (4) custom protocols (gstack://) for internal pages. Companies like Brave, Arc, and Vivaldi maintain Chromium forks with small teams. With CC, the rebase-on-upstream maintenance could be largely automated.

**Context:** Trigger criteria from V0 design doc: fork when extension side panel becomes the bottleneck, when anti-bot patches need to live deeper than CDP, or when native UI integration (sidebar, status bar) can't be done via extension. The Chromium build takes ~4 hours on a 32-core machine and produces ~50GB of build artifacts. CI would need dedicated build infra. See `docs/designs/GSTACK_BROWSER_V0.md` Phase 5 for full analysis.

**Effort:** XL (human: ~1 quarter / CC: ~2-3 weeks of focused work)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** CDP patches proving the value of anti-bot stealth first
